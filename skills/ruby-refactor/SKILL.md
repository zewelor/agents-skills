description: Review and refactor Ruby code while preserving behavior and keeping the design simple. Use for requested Ruby design or maintainability reviews, method or class restructuring, conditional simplification, coupling reduction, or idiom adoption. Use performance-focused guidance separately when runtime optimization is the goal.

# Ruby Refactoring

## Workflow

1. Read the project instructions, requested scope, callers, and relevant tests.
   Check the supported Ruby and framework versions before selecting syntax.
2. Identify a concrete maintenance problem. Prefer a local simplification over
   adding a class, protocol, helper, or compatibility layer without a current need.
3. Read only the references that address that problem. Treat their examples as
   conditional alternatives, not rules that make the original code incorrect.
4. Preserve public APIs, return values, exceptions, mutation and aliasing,
   evaluation order, side effects, and nil/false distinctions. State any intended
   contract change explicitly and keep it within the user's authorized scope.
5. Apply the smallest coherent change when implementation is requested. Keep
   reviews read-only; do not turn an audit into an unrequested rewrite.
6. Run the relevant existing checks. Add regression cases for changed behavior
   boundaries; use empty, nil, false, invalid, and repeated-call inputs where
   they distinguish the implementations. Recheck only affected behavior after edits.
7. Report the concrete improvement and validation limits. Do not claim a runtime
   speedup from a design change without measurement.

Keep established project conventions unless the requested change requires an
update. Reuse decisions and authorization already present in the conversation;
ask only about unresolved choices that materially affect the result.
